# we should know what data structure we receive
# with that we can work to get the components of the velocity at different
# points
# the main task is to get the freestream component of the flow and divide it by
# the freestream velocity
# then we can make a clear conclusion between 4 and 16 m/s about the viscosity
# This can be done using a planar graph of the velocity and let them intersect
# eachother
